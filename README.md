Build:  
Right now, the project can only get built on windows with msvc2010.  
Open the .sln file with VS2010 and build.  
  
How to use:  
Run the app and open a gesture data file through file menu.  
There is a sample file called gesture.dat in the root. In the future, generating data file may be supported.  
Then draw something with the mouse on the canvas.
